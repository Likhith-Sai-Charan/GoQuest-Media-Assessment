# Mobile Web-Based Dubbing Interface

This project is a prototype of a mobile web-based dubbing interface built with React and Vite. It allows users to dub over a video with their own audio recordings, synchronizing them with the video playback.

## Features

- Video playback with play/pause and seeking functionality
- Audio recording using the Web Audio API
- Dialogue display and navigation
- Mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Basic error handling

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)

## Running the Application

To run this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal).

## Approach and Use of AI-Assisted Coding

This project was developed using AI-assisted coding techniques to maximize productivity. The approach involved:

1. Defining clear requirements and features for the dubbing interface.
2. Utilizing AI to generate boilerplate code and component structures.
3. Leveraging AI suggestions for implementing complex functionalities like audio recording and video synchronization.
4. Using AI to assist in integrating third-party libraries and components (e.g., shadcn/ui).
5. Employing AI to help with state management implementation and optimization.

The AI assistant was particularly helpful in:
- Providing initial component structures and React hooks usage.
- Suggesting efficient ways to handle audio recording and playback.
- Assisting with Tailwind CSS classes for responsive design.
- Offering solutions for common challenges in web development.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

1. **Audio-Video Synchronization**: Ensuring that recorded audio plays back in sync with the video was challenging. This was overcome by carefully managing the currentTime property of both audio and video elements.

2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Creating a truly mobile-first design required careful consideration of layout and user interactions. Tailwind CSS classes and custom media queries were used to address this.

3. **State Management Complexity**: As the application grew, managing state became more complex. This was addressed by implementing a reducer pattern with React's Context API, providing a more scalable state management solution.

4. **Browser Compatibility**: Different browsers handle audio recording differently. A unified approach using the MediaRecorder API was implemented, with fallbacks and error handling for unsupported browsers.

## Future Improvements

Given more time, the following improvements and additions could be made:

1. **Enhanced Audio Visualization**: Implement a more sophisticated audio waveform visualization for better user feedback during recording.

2. **Server Integration**: Add backend services for saving and loading dubbing projects, allowing users to revisit and edit their work.

3. **Multi-language Support**: Implement a localization system to support multiple languages in the interface.

4. **Advanced Video Controls**: Add features like playback speed adjustment, full-screen mode, and volume control.

5. **AI-Assisted Dubbing**: Integrate speech recognition and machine translation APIs to provide initial translations and timing suggestions.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Implement lazy loading and code splitting to improve load times and overall performance.

7. **Comprehensive Testing**: Develop a robust testing suite using tools like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure reliability.

8. **Accessibility Improvements**: Enhance keyboard navigation and screen reader support for better accessibility.

9. **Collaborative Features**: Implement real-time collaboration features allowing multiple users to work on the same dubbing project simultaneously.

10. **Export Options**: Add functionality to export the dubbed video with the new audio track.
